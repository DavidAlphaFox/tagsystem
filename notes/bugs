* sorting_time should take in account the least time from all containing
  files (or at least all containing files at creation date), not just
  the least time of stat() at the directory

* doing a ts add then aborting, and trying again, might result in:

  ERROR: 23503: insert or update on table "thumbnail" violates foreign
  key constraint "thumbnail_file_id_fkey" Erro capturado:
  PGOCaml_generic.Make(Thread).PostgreSQL_Error("ERROR: 23503: insert or
  update on table \"thumbnail\" violates foreign key constraint
  \"thumbnail_file_id_fkey\"", _)

  hey! noo! it happens because you are doing it concurrently with
  another ts! that is; the default locking / sharing procedure is not
  enough

* it seems that when the transaction is initiated, one has to add all
  the files, and just after this allocate a new bag_id. is that right?
  also, if the transaction is aborted, the db has no info about
  duplicates, thus adding again will duplicate the repository..


* ooh! omg! omg! it looks like the race is at thumbnail.jpg!!!!! WTF!!!


* what means this?

  Erro capturado: Sys_error("No such file or directory")
