WEB

* creating a cursor + notify, for better performance

* also keeping a counter for "number of bags", with a trigger

* thumbnail expansion on mouse over

* little thumbnails on bag listing

FSCK

* ts fsck, with options; by default would check if database is 'dirty'
  (has open bags) 

* in the future, would check if the fetch log is clean; ifnot, replay
  them 

* extreme fsck: check md5sum of everything

* a tool for generating missing thumbnails, and dropping irrelevant ones;
  maybe integrated with ts fsck?

  or better: this tool would be like:

    ts thumbnail --add 800x600

    ts thumbnail --rem 800x600

    ts thumbnail --check

  it would:

  * modify the list of thumbnails, commit [ so that new adds would add
    correct thumbnails ]

  * begin transaction, search for all thumbnails and/or non-generated
    images, do stuff


MORE

* ts static for creating static pages. needs some static navigation and
  index. also an option for creating such pages *without* checking the
  db
