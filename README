Hi, this is tagsystem

Beware: it connects to the database and drop
tables upon compilation!

make             compile on demand
make run         compile on demand, then run

make force       always compiles
make all         compile program and doc
make doc         generate all doc

make clean       cleanup generated files

make html        generate html documentation
make tex         generate latex documentation
make pdf         generate pdf documentation

make mli         output the interface to stdout


There is not much more than a toy implemented
