Hi, this is tagsystem

Beware: it connects to the database and drop
tables upon compilation!

make             compile what is needed

make force       always compiles everything
make clean       cleanup generated files

make tagsystem   generates only the program
make doc         generates only documentation

make mli         output the interface to stdout

make run         compile what is needed, then run


Ugly: the way the host to connect is setup

Scattered in 3 files (Makefile for compile time,
ocaml-script for toplevel, run for runtime)

IDK how to connect to unix socket too


Also there is not much more than a toy implemented
